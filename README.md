How might we provide support to Black aspiring homeowners who face uncertainty about their readiness to buy a home?

How might we connect potential homebuyers with trusted realtors and resources that can help them prepare for homeownership?

How might we use technology to make the path to homeownership more transparent, equitable, and personalized?

Project Description 🤯

HomeReady is a web-based application designed to help users assess how prepared they are to purchase a home and connect them with the right support. Users enter key details such as income, credit score, down payment, and target home price, and the app evaluates their readiness level. Based on this, HomeReady guides users through tailored next steps — offering resources and financial tips for those who need improvement or connecting ready buyers directly with trusted realtors in their area.

HomeReady targets Black aspiring homeowners who want clarity on their financial readiness and access to trustworthy housing guidance. It also benefits realtors by connecting them with serious, ready-to-buy clients. The platform delivers tangible value by reducing uncertainty, improving financial literacy, and helping users make data-driven decisions about homeownership.
